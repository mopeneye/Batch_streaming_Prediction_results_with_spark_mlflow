# Batch_streaming_Prediction_results_with_spark_mlflow
Streaming prediction results built with random forest via mlflow

This project reads churn data with spark, uses pyspark ml library RandomForest classification model to predict whether a subscriber will exit or will not.
Batch streaming has been applied to read prediÃ¼ction results writes streaming data to postgres DB. This algoritm is controlled with spark's mlflow.

In order to use spark's mlflow, you sholuld perform tasks below:

1. Hadoop services must be running
2. activate your virtual environment for spark
3. Install dependencies of psycopg2 package, mlflow and necessary libs for model development.
```
sudo yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum -y install python3-devel
sudo yum -y install postgresql-libs
sudo yum -y install postgresql-devel
pip install psycopg2
pip install mlflow
pip install pyspark==3.0.0
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow  

4. Prepare postgresql as backend store  
` CREATE DATABASE mlflow OWNER train ENCODING 'UTF8'; `

5. Artifact store as HDFS  
` hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/train/mlflow `

5. Artifact store as HDFS  
` hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/train/mlflow `
5.1. Run mlflow server with hdfs artifact
```
(venvspark) [train@localhost mlflow]$ mlflow server \
--backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2://train:Ankara06@localhost:5432/mlflow \
--default-artifact-root hdfs://localhost:9000/user/train/mlflow \
--host 0.0.0.0  > mlflow_server.log 2>&1 &


6. See the postgresql tables are created.

```
postgres=# \c mlflow
psql (9.2.24, server 10.13)
WARNING: psql version 9.2, server version 10.0.
         Some psql features might not work.
You are now connected to database "mlflow" as user "postgres".
mlflow=# \dt
               List of relations
